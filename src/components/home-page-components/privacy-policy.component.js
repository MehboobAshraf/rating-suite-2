            At Hensu LLC (“Ratingsuite”, "we," "our," or "us"), we take your privacy and the security of your information very seriously.
            This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers the personal information we collect about you when you use our products or
            services, or otherwise interact with us, including on our website at https://www.ratingsuite.com, and our related online and
            offline offerings (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is part of, our Terms of Service
            available at https://www.ratingsuite.com/terms which govern your access to the Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and share your personal
            information and to assist you in exercising the privacy rights available to you. By using our Service, you consent to the
            collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information described in this Privacy Policy. If
            you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use any of our services. Accordingly, when you use any of our
            Services, you should check the date of this Policy and review any changes since you last reviewed the Policy.

          <p>
            We use third-party payment providers to process payments on the Services. We may receive information associated with your
            payment information, such as billing address and transaction information (“Billing Information”), but we do not directly store
            payment information on the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you create an account or otherwise use the Services, we collect information such as your name, company name, email address,
            phone number, and role within your team or enterprise (“Personal Contact Information”).
          </p>
          <p>
            As you use our Services, Ratingsuite may also collect information through the use of frequently used information-gathering
            tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Website Navigational Information”). Website Navigational Information includes standard
            information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the
            actions you take on Ratingsuite’s website (such as web pages viewed and links clicked). <br />
            <br />
            We may use third parties, such as GoogleAnalytics or other analytics providers, to analyze traffic to our Site. They have their
            own privacy policies addressing how they use the analytics and other information and we do not have access to, nor control over,
            third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

            We use this information primarily to administer our Services to you and provide you with updates and product announcements. Per
            the Privacy and Conditions, we may use some of your information for marketing purposes.
          </p>

            Ratingsuite may use your Analytics Information in conjunction with an analytics service such as Google Analytics to monitor and
            analyze use of the Services, to increase the Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the
            authorization required for the Services to process their requests.

            Some parts of the Service are made available on a paid subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). Pricing for the Subscriptions is

            <br />
            You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or
            annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. <br />
            <br />
            You agree that at the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew and your payment method for such
            Subscription will automatically be charged at the start of each new Subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to
            that Billing Cycle, under the same conditions as the prior Billing Cycle unless you cancel it or Ratingsuite cancels it. <br />
            <br />
            A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide
            Ratingsuite with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and
            valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Ratingsuite to charge all
            Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. <br />
            <br />
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Ratingsuite may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more
            times. Should payment continue to fail, the Subscription will be cancelled. <br />

            Ratingsuite, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription
            fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. <br />
            <br />
            Ratingsuite will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to

            <br />

            <br />
            Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added,
            sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all
            Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be
            subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.

            <br />
            If the parties are not able to resolve the dispute through Ratingsuite customer support, Customer and Ratingsuite agree to
            resolve any dispute arising under these Terms or in relation to the Service by binding arbitration in location both parties
            agree to. <br />
            <br />
            Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not
            permitted. That means neither you nor Ratingsuite can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action,
            consolidated action, or representative action. The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s or entity’s claims into a
            single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless both parties agree otherwise).
            And, the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s or entity’s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the
            claim, not other Ratingsuite customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers. You understand that by
            agreeing to these Terms, you and Ratingsuite are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or
            class arbitration.
